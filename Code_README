## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model capable of classifying images of 90 different animal species. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with MobileNetV2 as the base model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Animal Image Dataset (90 different animals)](https://www.kaggle.com/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals) available on Kaggle. The dataset contains images of 90 different animal species.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mannav1104/Animal_Classification_Manav_Shah.git
   ```
2. Change to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd Animal_Classification_Manav_Shah
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Download and extract the dataset:
   ```sh
   kaggle datasets download -d iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Multi_Class_Animal_Classification.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The model is trained to classify 90 different animal species. Example results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
